## UX Framework

### Strategy

The Services Beyond is an online platform to access various services with front-end and back-end functionality, created using HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Python, Flask, and MongoDB. The goal is to create a website that is user-friendly and allows users to easily search and get various available services.

### Scope

The website is interactive and allows users to input or add their own services for other users to view or display, allowing them to edit and delete their registered services and search for different services. The website has CRUD functionality.

#### Functional Requirements

Functional requirements include: a user-friendly navigation menu, a search bar, working templates for services to be added, database functionality that stores user login information and ability to create new accounts, with authentication. In addition, the website should be responsive for various screen sizes, maintaining the same level of functionality. The main functionality of the website is to allow users to create, read, update, and delete data, known as CRUD. The data created is stored in a database, and can be read through various pages on the website. The users also have the option to update and edit the data they have submitted, as well as delete it altogether. A search field allows users to search for specific services they are interested in.

#### Content Requirements

The content of the site should include a header and image, as well as a navigation menu. A search bar should allow users to search for services types. For the services there are specific categories from the users chooses from  and a short description of the service, adding your contact information through contact number and email address and the date on which you need the services to be rendered. An input field for users will allow them to select specific services.

### Structures

The website is structured to allow new visitors to view specific services after you register and login. Once they open the landing page they can other users requests, which will give them idea create and view their profile page of existing services. Once logged in, users are able to click on the main header, which allows them to search for different services, as well as add and edit their own services. In addition, the users are able to save the registered services. Once the user wishes to end their session, they can click the 'Log Out' option in the menu to return to the home page.

### Skeleton

The skeleton of the website will utilise Materialize for the CSS layout of the pages. A navigation menu will allow users to go to their chosen pages. The main landing page will function to allow users to select numerous service types they are interested in, and provide links to add or edit their own services. This minimises the need for different pages for users to visit and provides a seamless experience. When adding or editing a service, additional options in the navigation menu allow the user to navigate back to their own profile, or to end the session and log out. This simplifies the number of options for the user and keeps the website easy to use.

### Surface

The surface design of the website will also utilise Materialize CSS to provide a theme and styling for the components of the website. Google Fonts is used to style the text using the 'Oswald' and 'Ephesis' fonts  and FontAwesome is used for various icons. The color scheme is designed to be fall colors appealing to the target audience of varied professionals, and provide clear readability as well as being responsive.
